# APRSViewJS
Experimental APRS Client.  Currently testing rewriting using Vue and Electron.

See js-aprs-fap, js-aprs-is. More projects planned including GPS, ULS integration, tnc lib, app engine to tie all components together. This will allow for independent UIs to be created. Any help would be much appreciated!
